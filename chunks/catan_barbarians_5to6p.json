The new quarries and glassworks have a slightly different design than the\ncorresponding hexes in Traders & Barbarians. The new hexes also allow you to build roads\nand settlements on the coast, which is necessary to reach certain harbors. Make sure to place\nthese hexes next to frame pieces showing harbors. You should be able to reach all harbors, as\nshown in the illustration on page 8.\n• Fill the free spaces of the island with terrain hexes, in random order. You need all terrain hexes\nfrom CATAN as well as from CATAN 5-6.\n• Place the number tokens exactly as shown in the illustration on page 8. You need all of the\nnumber tokens from CATAN 5-6.\nNote: Because of the large number of hexes that require no number token, the number\ntokens cannot be distributed in alphabetical order as usual.\n77\n\n\n\n• Place the commodity tokens produced by the castle beside the game board. Arrange the\ncommodity tokens of the marble quarry into 3 stacks of approximately the same size and place\none stack next to each quarry. Proceed accordingly for the commodity tokens of the glassworks.\nShould the card stack next to one of the quarries or glassworks become depleted during the\ngame, you may also draw from either of the other two stacks—the individual stacks are not\nassigned to a particular trade hex. The arrows in the illustration below indicate the suggested\nlocations for the stacks of commodity tokens.\n• There are still only 3 barbarians in a game with 5 or 6 players.

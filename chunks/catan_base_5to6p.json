It offers the promise of bountiful harvests\nand plentiful resources. As you make plans to build a new life here, you discover\nthat you are not alone. Several other newly-arrived leaders are planning their\nfutures here as well. The race to build a bright and prosperous new community has\nbegun!\n\nThe CATAN® – 5-6 Player Extension™ (aka CATAN 5-6) allows you to add one to two\nplayers to your CATAN games. The island is larger, the demand for resources is fiercer, and\nthe thrills are even greater!\nNOTE: This 2022 revision has new “paired player” rules that replace the special building phase\nfound in previous editions of CATAN 5-6. Longtime CATAN fans should take note. You can\ndownload the new rules from catan.com for free."

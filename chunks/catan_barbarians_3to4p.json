    "text": "Dear Players,Content: Ten years ago, after publishing Catan–Cities & Knights™, I was asked if there would be a third expansion of the\nBase Game. I answered in the negative at that time, because I thought that all wishes to experience more in Catan\nhad been fulfilled. With Catan–Seafarers , the game was extended spatially, and Cities & Knights provided it with\n®\ngreater depth.\nAt the beginning of 2006, we started a survey in the Catan Online World where, among other things, we asked the\ncitizens of this virtual game world which games they would want the most. “Variants of the base game” appeared at the\nvery top of the wish list.\nThis vote encouraged me to consolidate and further develop ideas for interesting variants and expansions that had\npiled up in my drawer during the past 10 years. And now you’re holding the outcome in your hands!\nA campaign with 5 scenarios opens up entirely new challenges and possibilities to experience the base game in a new\nfashion, and well-established variants offer alternatives to adapt the game to one’s own needs.\n\nHence, this expansion is all about “variants of the basic bame,” and the complexity of the last two scenarios of the\ncampaign almost comes up to the standard of Cities & Knights.\nIt is impossible to bring an expansion of this scope to a satisfactory conclusion all by oneself. I therefore want to\nsincerely thank all those fellow settlers mentioned under “Rule Testing and Advice” in the Credits section of this booklet\nfor their valuable help."

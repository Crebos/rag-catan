# RAG for Catan game rules

## Project Description

This project is the final assignment for the AI Applications module at ZHAW School of Management and Law. The goal is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that equips a language model with detailed knowledge of the official Settlers of Catan rules. The core idea is to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to answer game-related questions accurately by grounding its responses in the actual rulebook (provided as a PDF).

To achieve this, I'm using the LangChain framework along with FAISS for semantic search over embedded rule chunks. The RAG pipeline connects these pieces to a language model that generates context-aware responses. The end result will be a functional Gradio web app that lets users interact with the model in real time.

I documented the process aswell as trials and errors in a separate file "BLOG.md".

## Chunking

### Data Chunking Method

The data was chunked with the following logic to improve the performance of the RAG model:

| Type of Chunking                         |                     Configuration |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------: |
| RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter           | chunk_size=600, chunk_overlap=100 |
| Manual splitting by layout and paragraph |                                   |
| Token aware Chunking                     |  chunk_size=128, chunk_overlap=24 |
| Token aware Chunking                     |    chunk_size=52, chunk_overlap=8 |
| Token aware Chunking                     |  chunk_size=112, chunk_overlap=22 |

## Choice of LLM

| Name | Link                                                                                              |

## Test Method

At first tests I simply tested with a simple Query
query = "I have all the necessary resources and it is my turn. Where can I place a city? Anywhere connected to a road, right?"
and manually interpreting the output, since the output already should have self explanatory text, which are understandable.

Later I expanded the Queries to reflect more information across documents:
query = "How do you acquire resources during the game?" # Answer in catan_base_3to4p.pdf at page 11 (you gotta dice the numbers where your settlements are)
query = "How do you get the Longest Road special card and what happens if another player builds a longer road?" # Answer in catan_base_3to4p.pdf at page 5 (5 continoous reoad segments (and longest))
query = "What do you need to play a Seafarers 5-6 Player scenario?" # Answer in catan_seafarers_5to6p.pdf at page 2 (you need Catan & Catan 5&6p, and seafarers game)
query = "How should you assemble the game board for a Seafarers scenario?" # Answer in catan_seafarers_5to6p.pdf at page 2 (Assemble frame as in the photo and place tiles ..)
query = "What happens when the barbarian ship reaches Catan?" # Answer in catan_barbarians_3to4p.pdf at page 7 (must compare knight strength to barbarians strength)
query = "How are knights used in the game, and what actions can they perform?" # Answer in catan_barbarians_3to4p.pdf at page 6 (msut be activated by paying 1 grain, then he can used)

## Results

| Model/Method                     | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Retrieved chunks with config xyz | -        | -         | -      |
| Generated answer with config xyz | -        | -         | -      |
